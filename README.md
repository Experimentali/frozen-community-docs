# Welcome to the Community Documentation
Hey! You appear to have stumbled upon the community docs. This documentation is not directed by FrozenHosting, but by the community. FrozenHosting will rarely add documents here, so it is up to the community for that. If you have a document you want to add, check it doesn't already exist.

# Contributing

1. Fork Repo
2. Enable Actions
3. Wait for branch `gh-pages` to appear
4. Set branch `gh-pages` as GitHub Pages MasterBranch.
